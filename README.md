# DDMISP: Data-driven method to infer the seizure propagation patterns

This repository contains the code and data associated with [1].


## Structure

- The directory `preproc/` contains the code to preprocess the data: prepare the structural connectomes, detect the onset times in the intracranial EEG recordings, and map them on the brain regions.
- The directory `ddmisp/` contains the code for the simulation, inference, analysis, and visualization.

Further details are described in each directory. Due to the nature of the patient data used in the study, these are available upon reasonable request from the authors.

## Environment

Python 3.7 with multiple scientific and neuroscientic libraries is necessary. Use the environment file `env.yml` to prepare the conda environment.
